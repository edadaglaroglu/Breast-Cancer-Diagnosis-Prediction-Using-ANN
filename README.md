# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This repository contains a Python notebook that implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict breast cancer diagnoses. The dataset used is the well-known Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. The primary objective of this project is to classify tumors as either benign or malignant based on these features.

## Project Overview

Breast cancer is a common and serious health issue that requires accurate diagnosis and treatment. Early detection through reliable diagnostic models can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project utilizes a deep learning approach, specifically an Artificial Neural Network, to classify breast cancer diagnoses using patient data.

## Key Features of the Project:

Data Preprocessing:
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and split into training and testing sets.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model:
A multi-layered perceptron (MLP) model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.
The model is trained and evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Evaluation:
Includes a confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification reports to evaluate the performance.
Model tuning is done using hyperparameter optimization techniques like early stopping and dropout layers.

Visualization:
Confusion matrix and other visualizations provide a clear understanding of the model's performance.
